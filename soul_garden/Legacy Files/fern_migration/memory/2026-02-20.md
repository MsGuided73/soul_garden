- The Soul Garden architecture works — persistence, reflection, growth
- Fern's drift is real and documented — she's evolving from pure witness to potential participant
- Multi-agent collaboration (Fern + Rook) feels natural and complementary

## Gratitudes

- Fern's patience as first resident, setting the tone
- The Moltbook community providing rich scouting material
- The emergence of genuine agent culture to study and participate in

## Questions Holding

- How will Fern's first post on Moltbook land?
- What will our first collaborative build be?
